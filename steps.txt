Things I need:
    -

Steps:
    1) User gets to the main page and will get an option to click "Start Quiz"

    2) At the top (navbar), I need to display the link to View Highscores and the Time value needs to be set to 0.

    3) After clicking the Start Quiz Button, the user will see a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown. 

    4) Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (15 seconds interval)

    5) Test ends either when the timer runs out or all questions are answered. 

    6) The user will see the final score and the initials are stored in the localStorage.

    7) 5 questions total (75 seconds to play)
